Subversion Access
-----------------

You can obtain the latest development version from our subversion (SVN) repository. The easiest way to browse through the repository is using the [web source code browser | http://code.google.com/p/dibi/source/browse]. We recommend you install an SVN client on your machine for better access. [TortoiseSVN | http://tortoisesvn.net/] is a highly recommended client on Windows.

Use this command to anonymously check out the latest project source code:
